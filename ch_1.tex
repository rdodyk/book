    \chapter{The Importance of Boundaries}
    The one thing that seems to densify a city is the existance of natural boundaries that completely resist any expansion.
    Think of New York City, or Toronto, or London, or any city in Japan really.
    They all have very firm boundaries defining the limits of their expansion.

    Now, why can't we use this example from nature to make any city more sustainable?
    There's nothing stopping us from just saying ``Nope, sorry, you can't build anything past this point'', well except for developers offering local governments lots of money if they relax those restrictions a bit.
